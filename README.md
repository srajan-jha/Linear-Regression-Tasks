# Linear-Regression-Tasks
The repo contains few projects and tasks in .ipynb notebooks, while other files are the data which are used to perform the task. The projects are done by myself while starting with my journey of ML. The exercises were provided by an online course which I took. However, I played with some parameters while practicing and this is the final project which I was left with at the end.
